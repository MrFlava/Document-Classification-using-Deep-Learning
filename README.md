Dataset-Tobacco3482 dataset. (link is provided in the blog)

Implementation is for 3 classes: 'Note', 'Scientific' and 'Report'.

The same approach you can apply for 6 classes as in the dataset.

Data: Consists of 3 classes data (Note, Scientific and Report)

Final_code.ipynb is the implementation provided for 3 classes.

(This is the basic code provided for understanding of Document classification using deep learning. 
You can enhance the performance by tuning the model, increasing epochs and increasing the size of dataset)
